# This is the _final_ motherfucking website.

And it's _really_ more fucking perfect than the last guy's.

## Seriously, some minimal fucking things are needed to make this shit perfect.

**Ten fucking declarations, a `@media` block, and one attribute.**

That's how much CSS and HTML it took to turn that [grotesque pile of shit](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) into this finally perfect masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:

* Shit's _finally_ lightweight and loads fast;
* _Finally_ fits on all your shitty screens;
* _Finally_ looks the same in all your shitty browsers;
* _Won't_ bleach your fucking eyeballs at night if your browser thinks you like dark things;
* The motherfucker's _still_ accessible to every asshole that visits your site;
* Shit's _still_ legible and gets your fucking point across.

### And guess what, motherfucker:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve reliability on your site. Here's how.

## A little more accessibility

I know you love marginalization, but you should take care of people.
The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag doesn't include the [`lang` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes) in your shitty webpage.  
You ever listen to a [wrong language screen reader lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP94u7y_KkQ)? What a shitty experience.

## Typography matters

[Don't be dumb with typography](https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/). Don't let improper marks and quotes make their way onto websites because of dumb defaults in applications and CMSs.  
And did you let the browser choose the font? Don't make me read such text with _Times New Roman_.

## License, motherfucker

Do you revendicate intellectual property? No. So you must [choose a fucking public license](https://choosealicense.com/).  
And as you'll never be perfect, let others [improve your shit](https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite) or [do what the fuck they want to](https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Yes, this is the last fucking satire, you fuck

I'm impressed about what the creator of [this site's inspiration did](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/). What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default—they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
